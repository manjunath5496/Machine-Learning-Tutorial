<p><strong>Machine learning</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>ML</strong>) is the&nbsp;<a title="Branches of science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science">scientific study</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Statistical model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">statistical models</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Computer systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_systems">computer systems</a>&nbsp;use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and&nbsp;<a title="Inference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference">inference</a>&nbsp;instead. It is seen as a subset of&nbsp;<a title="Artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. Machine learning algorithms build a&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">mathematical model</a>&nbsp;based on sample data, known as "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Training data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data">training data</a>", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.&nbsp;Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as&nbsp;<a title="Email filtering" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering">email filtering</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Computer vision" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a>, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.</p>
<p>Machine learning is closely related to&nbsp;<a title="Computational statistics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics">computational statistics</a>, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical optimization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">mathematical optimization</a>&nbsp;delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">Data mining</a>&nbsp;is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on&nbsp;<a title="Exploratory data analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis">exploratory data analysis</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a title="Unsupervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a>.&nbsp;In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as&nbsp;<a title="Predictive analytics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics">predictive analytics</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Overview" class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The name&nbsp;<em>machine learning</em>&nbsp;was coined in 1959 by&nbsp;<a title="Arthur Samuel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a>.<a title="Tom M. Mitchell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell">Tom M. Mitchell</a>&nbsp;provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience&nbsp;<em>E</em>&nbsp;with respect to some class of tasks&nbsp;<em>T</em>&nbsp;and performance measure&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;if its performance at tasks in&nbsp;<em>T</em>, as measured by&nbsp;<em>P</em>, improves with experience&nbsp;<em>E</em>."&nbsp;This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally&nbsp;<a title="Operational definition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition">operational definition</a>&nbsp;rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows&nbsp;<a title="Alan Turing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s proposal in his paper "<a title="Computing Machinery and Intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".&nbsp;In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a&nbsp;<em>thinking machine</em>&nbsp;and the various implications in constructing one are exposed.</p>

A&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Support vector machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a>&nbsp;is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a&nbsp;<a title="Linear classifier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier">linear boundary</a>. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white.</div>

<p>Machine learning tasks are classified into several broad categories. In&nbsp;<a title="Supervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a>, the algorithm builds a&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">mathematical model</a>&nbsp;from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. For example, if the task were determining whether an image contained a certain object, the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Training data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data">training data</a>&nbsp;for a supervised learning algorithm would include images with and without that object (the input), and each image would have a label (the output) designating whether it contained the object. In special cases, the input may be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback.&nbsp;<a title="Semi-supervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">Semi-supervised learning</a>&nbsp;algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.</p>
<p><a title="Statistical classification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">Classification</a>&nbsp;algorithms and&nbsp;<a title="Regression analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a>&nbsp;algorithms are types of supervised learning. Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Discrete number" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_number">limited set</a>&nbsp;of values. For a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. For an algorithm that identifies spam emails, the output would be the prediction of either "<a title="Email spam" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam">spam</a>" or "not spam", represented by the&nbsp;<a title="Boolean data type" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type">Boolean</a>&nbsp;values true and false.&nbsp;<a title="Regression analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">Regression</a>&nbsp;algorithms are named for their continuous outputs, meaning they may have any value within a range. Examples of a continuous value are the temperature, length, or price of an object.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a title="Unsupervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a>, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains only inputs and no desired output labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find structure in the data, like grouping or&nbsp;<a title="Cluster analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering</a>&nbsp;of data points. Unsupervised learning can discover patterns in the data, and can group the inputs into categories, as in&nbsp;<a title="Feature learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning">feature learning</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Dimensionality reduction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction">Dimensionality reduction</a>&nbsp;is the process of reducing the number of "<a title="Feature (machine learning)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a>", or inputs, in a set of data.</p>

<p><a title="Arthur Samuel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a>, an American pioneer in the field of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Computer gaming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_gaming">computer gaming</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959 while at&nbsp;<a title="IBM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a>.&nbsp;A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.&nbsp;The interest of machine learning related to pattern recognition continued during the 1970s, as described in the book of Duda and Hart in 1973.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an&nbsp;<a title="Discipline (academia)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_(academia)">academic discipline</a>, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "<a title="Neural network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>"; these were mostly&nbsp;<a title="Perceptron" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptrons</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="ADALINE" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE">other models</a>&nbsp;that were later found to be reinventions of the&nbsp;<a title="Generalized linear model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear models</a>&nbsp;of statistics.&nbsp;<a title="Probability theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">Probabilistic</a>&nbsp;reasoning was also employed, especially in automated&nbsp;<a title="Medical diagnosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis">medical diagnosis</a>.</p>
<p>However, an increasing emphasis on the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="GOFAI" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">logical, knowledge-based approach</a>&nbsp;caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.&nbsp;By 1980,&nbsp;<a title="Expert system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">expert systems</a>&nbsp;had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.&nbsp;Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to&nbsp;<a title="Inductive logic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming">inductive logic programming</a>, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in&nbsp;<a title="Pattern recognition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition">pattern recognition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Information retrieval" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval">information retrieval</a>.&nbsp;Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and&nbsp;<a title="Computer science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>&nbsp;around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "<a title="Connectionism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">connectionism</a>", by researchers from other disciplines including&nbsp;<a title="John Hopfield" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopfield">Hopfield</a>,&nbsp;<a title="David Rumelhart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart">Rumelhart</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Geoff Hinton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hinton">Hinton</a>. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of&nbsp;<a title="Backpropagation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a>.</p>
<p>Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the&nbsp;<a title="Symbolic artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">symbolic approaches</a>&nbsp;it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and&nbsp;<a title="Probability theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">probability theory</a>.&nbsp;It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the&nbsp;<a title="Internet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Relation_to_data_mining" class="mw-headline">Relation to data mining</span></h3>
<p>Machine learning and&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>&nbsp;often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on&nbsp;<em>known</em>&nbsp;properties learned from the training data,&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>&nbsp;focuses on the&nbsp;<a title="Discovery (observation)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)">discovery</a>&nbsp;of (previously)&nbsp;<em>unknown</em>&nbsp;properties in the data (this is the analysis step of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Knowledge discovery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_discovery">knowledge discovery</a>&nbsp;in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals,&nbsp;<a title="ECML PKDD" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECML_PKDD">ECML PKDD</a>&nbsp;being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to&nbsp;<em>reproduce known</em>&nbsp;knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously&nbsp;<em>unknown</em>&nbsp;knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.</p>
<h3><span id="Relation_to_optimization" class="mw-headline">Relation to optimization</span></h3>
<p>Machine learning also has intimate ties to&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical optimization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">optimization</a>: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some&nbsp;<a title="Loss function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">loss function</a>&nbsp;on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.</p>
<h3><span id="Relation_to_statistics" class="mw-headline">Relation to statistics</span></h3>
<p>Machine learning and&nbsp;<a title="Statistics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statistics</a>&nbsp;are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population&nbsp;<a title="Statistical inference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">inferences</a>&nbsp;from a&nbsp;<a title="Sample (statistics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)">sample</a>, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a title="Michael I. Jordan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I._Jordan">Michael I. Jordan</a>, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.&nbsp;He also suggested the term&nbsp;<a title="Data science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a>&nbsp;as a placeholder to call the overall field.</p>
<p><a title="Leo Breiman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman">Leo Breiman</a>&nbsp;distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,&nbsp;wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like&nbsp;<a title="Random forest" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random forest</a>.</p>
<p>Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call&nbsp;<em>statistical learning</em>.</p>
<h2><span id="Theory" class="mw-headline"><span id="Generalization"></span>Theory</span></h2>
<p>A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.&nbsp;Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.</p>
<p>The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of&nbsp;<a title="Theoretical computer science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science">theoretical computer science</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;<a title="Computational learning theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory">computational learning theory</a>. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Bias&ndash;variance decomposition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_decomposition">bias&ndash;variance decomposition</a>&nbsp;is one way to quantify generalization&nbsp;<a title="Errors and residuals" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals">error</a>.</p>
<p>For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to&nbsp;<a title="Overfitting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>&nbsp;and generalization will be poorer.</p>
<p>In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in&nbsp;<a title="Time complexity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time">polynomial time</a>. There are two kinds of&nbsp;<a title="Time complexity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a>&nbsp;results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.</p>
<h2><span id="Approaches" class="mw-headline">Approaches</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Types_of_learning_algorithms" class="mw-headline">Types of learning algorithms</span></h3>
<p>The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.</p>
<h4><span id="Supervised_learning" class="mw-headline">Supervised learning</span></h4>
<p>Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.&nbsp;The data is known as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Training data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data">training data</a>, and consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an&nbsp;<a title="Array data structure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">array</a>&nbsp;or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a&nbsp;<a title="Matrix (mathematics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)">matrix</a>. Through iterative optimization of an&nbsp;<a title="Loss function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function">objective function</a>, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.&nbsp;An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.</p>
<p>Supervised learning algorithms include&nbsp;<a title="Statistical classification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Regression analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression</a>.&nbsp;Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.&nbsp;<a title="Similarity learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning">Similarity learning</a>&nbsp;is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in&nbsp;<a title="Ranking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking">ranking</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Recommendation systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendation_systems">recommendation systems</a>, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.</p>
<p>In the case of&nbsp;<a title="Semi-supervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">semi-supervised</a>&nbsp;learning algorithms, some of the training examples are missing training labels, but they can nevertheless be used to improve the quality of a model. In&nbsp;<a title="Weak supervision" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision">weakly supervised learning</a>, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.</p>
<h4><span id="Unsupervised_learning" class="mw-headline">Unsupervised learning</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of&nbsp;<a title="Density estimation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation">density estimation</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a title="Statistics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statistics</a>,&nbsp;though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.</p>
<p>Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called&nbsp;<em>clusters</em>) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some&nbsp;<em>similarity metric</em>&nbsp;and evaluated, for example, by&nbsp;<em>internal compactness</em>, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and&nbsp;<em>separation</em>, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on&nbsp;<em>estimated density</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>graph connectivity</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-supervised learning</strong></p>
<p>Semi-supervised learning falls between&nbsp;<a title="Unsupervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a>&nbsp;(without any labeled training data) and&nbsp;<a title="Supervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a>&nbsp;(with completely labeled training data). Many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.</p>
<h4><span id="Reinforcement_learning" class="mw-headline">Reinforcement learning</span></h4>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how&nbsp;<a title="Software agent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent">software agents</a>&nbsp;ought to take&nbsp;<a title="Action selection" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_selection">actions</a>&nbsp;in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as&nbsp;<a title="Game theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Control theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Operations research" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">operations research</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Information theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Simulation-based optimization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation-based_optimization">simulation-based optimization</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Multi-agent system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system">multi-agent systems</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Swarm intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence">swarm intelligence</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Statistics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statistics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Genetic algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Markov Decision Process" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_Decision_Process">Markov Decision Process</a>&nbsp;(MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use&nbsp;<a title="Dynamic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>&nbsp;techniques.&nbsp;Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.</p>
<h4><span id="Self_learning" class="mw-headline">Self learning</span></h4>
<p>Self-learning as machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advices. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:</p>

```ML
 In situation s perform action a;
 Receive consequence situation s’;
 Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s’);
 Update crossbar memory  w’(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s’).
```


<p>It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span id="Feature_learning" class="mw-headline">Feature learning</span></h4>
<p>Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.&nbsp;Classic examples include&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Principal components analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis">principal components analysis</a>&nbsp;and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual&nbsp;<a title="Feature engineering" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.</p>
<p>Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include&nbsp;<a title="Artificial neural network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artificial neural networks</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Multilayer perceptron" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">multilayer perceptrons</a>, and supervised&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Dictionary learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_learning">dictionary learning</a>. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning,&nbsp;<a title="Independent component analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis">independent component analysis</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Autoencoder" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">autoencoders</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Matrix decomposition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition">matrix factorization</a>&nbsp;and various forms of&nbsp;<a title="Cluster analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-jurafsky_35-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" title="Manifold learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_learning">Manifold learning</a>&nbsp;algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sparse coding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_coding">Sparse coding</a>&nbsp;algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.&nbsp;<a title="Multilinear subspace learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_subspace_learning">Multilinear subspace learning</a>&nbsp;algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from&nbsp;<a title="Tensor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor">tensor</a>&nbsp;representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.&nbsp;<a title="Deep learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep learning</a>&nbsp;algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.</p>
<p>Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.</p>
<h4><span id="Sparse_dictionary_learning" class="mw-headline">Sparse dictionary learning</span></h4>
<p>Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of&nbsp;<a title="Basis function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function">basis functions</a>, and is assumed to be a&nbsp;<a title="Sparse matrix" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse matrix</a>. The method is&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Strongly NP-hard" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_NP-hard">strongly NP-hard</a>&nbsp;and difficult to solve approximately.&nbsp;A popular&nbsp;<a title="Heuristic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristic</a>&nbsp;method for sparse dictionary learning is the&nbsp;<a title="K-SVD" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-SVD">K-SVD</a>&nbsp;algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Image de-noising" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_de-noising">image de-noising</a>. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.</p>
<h4><span id="Anomaly_detection" class="mw-headline">Anomaly detection</span></h4>
<p>In&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.&nbsp;Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as&nbsp;<a title="Bank fraud" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud">bank fraud</a>, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as&nbsp;<a title="Outlier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier">outliers</a>, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.</p>
<p>In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts in activity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data, unless it has been aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.</p>
<p>Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.&nbsp;Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.</p>

<p>Association rule learning is a&nbsp;<a title="Rule-based machine learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_machine_learning">rule-based machine learning</a>&nbsp;method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of "interestingness".</p>
<p>Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.&nbsp;Rule-based machine learning approaches include&nbsp;<a title="Learning classifier system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system">learning classifier systems</a>, association rule learning, and&nbsp;<a title="Artificial immune system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_immune_system">artificial immune systems</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the concept of strong rules,&nbsp;<a title="Rakesh Agrawal (computer scientist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Agrawal_(computer_scientist)">Rakesh Agrawal</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Tomasz Imieliński" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Imieli%C5%84ski">Tomasz Imieliński</a>&nbsp;and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Point-of-sale" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-sale">point-of-sale</a>&nbsp;(POS) systems in supermarkets.&nbsp;For example, the rule&nbsp;<span class="mwe-math-element"><img class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" src="onion.png" alt="onion.png" /></span>&nbsp;found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional&nbsp;<a title="Pricing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing">pricing</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Product placement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement">product placements</a>. In addition to&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Market basket analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket_analysis">market basket analysis</a>, association rules are employed today in application areas including&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Web usage mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_usage_mining">Web usage mining</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Intrusion detection" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection">intrusion detection</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Continuous production" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_production">continuous production</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Bioinformatics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>. In contrast with&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sequence mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_mining">sequence mining</a>, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.</p>
<p>Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a&nbsp;<a title="Genetic algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a>, with a learning component, performing either&nbsp;<a title="Supervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Reinforcement learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>, or&nbsp;<a title="Unsupervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a>. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a&nbsp;<a title="Piecewise" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise">piecewise</a>&nbsp;manner in order to make predictions.</p>
<p>Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using&nbsp;<a title="Logic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>&nbsp;as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Entailment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment">entails</a>&nbsp;all positive and no negative examples.&nbsp;<a title="Inductive programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_programming">Inductive programming</a>&nbsp;is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as&nbsp;<a title="Functional programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programs</a>.</p>
<p>Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in&nbsp;<a title="Bioinformatics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Natural language processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Gordon Plotkin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Plotkin">Gordon Plotkin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Ehud Shapiro" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Shapiro">Ehud Shapiro</a>&nbsp;laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.&nbsp;Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.&nbsp;The term&nbsp;<em>inductive</em>&nbsp;here refers to&nbsp;<a title="Inductive reasoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">philosophical</a>&nbsp;induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical induction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical</a>&nbsp;induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.</p>
