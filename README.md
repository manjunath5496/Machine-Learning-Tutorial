<p><strong>Machine learning</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>ML</strong>) is the&nbsp;<a title="Branches of science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science">scientific study</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="Algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Statistical model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model">statistical models</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Computer systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_systems">computer systems</a>&nbsp;use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and&nbsp;<a title="Inference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference">inference</a>&nbsp;instead. It is seen as a subset of&nbsp;<a title="Artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. Machine learning algorithms build a&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model">mathematical model</a>&nbsp;based on sample data, known as "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Training data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data">training data</a>", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.&nbsp;Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as&nbsp;<a title="Email filtering" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering">email filtering</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Computer vision" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a>, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.</p>
<p>Machine learning is closely related to&nbsp;<a title="Computational statistics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics">computational statistics</a>, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical optimization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization">mathematical optimization</a>&nbsp;delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">Data mining</a>&nbsp;is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on&nbsp;<a title="Exploratory data analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis">exploratory data analysis</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a title="Unsupervised learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">unsupervised learning</a>.&nbsp;In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as&nbsp;<a title="Predictive analytics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics">predictive analytics</a>.</p>
